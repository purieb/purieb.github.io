Dear All,

It is with deep regret that we announce the permanent closure of PURI eBike, after almost 14 years of operation. Since its inception, there have been times when keeping the business afloat proved to be a struggle due to various challenges such as adapting to the market, navigating ever-changing laws and guidelines, dealing with the manufacturer's lack of quality control, and coping with fluctuating AUD and shipping costs.

Despite these challenges, we experienced many good times and I would like to express my personal gratitude to PURI eBike for providing me a platform to engage with the community. It was an honour to understand the needs of our customers and to have our products and services positively impact your lives. As an immigrant, this gave me immense pride and a sense of belonging in Australia.

I would also like to extend my deepest apologies for any inconvenience caused by us, whether it was due to our attitude, pricing, lack of parts or stock, or the occasionally subpar quality control. Most importantly, our inability to truly solve these problems has been our greatest regret.

The final blow to the business was dealt by COVID-19, which greatly disrupted our supply chain. Despite our efforts to keep the business going by paying above the odds, we find ourselves unable to continue due to a lack of resources and will.

We wish to express our sincere thanks to our loyal customers for their understanding and support throughout PURI eBike's existence. It has been a joyful ride for us all.


Godspeed to all.
